## Project Overview
This initiative focuses on analyzing and visualizing air quality data. It encompasses scripts for data preparation, exploratory analysis, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard for data visualization. The aim is to uncover patterns, connections, and trends in air quality within a specific area, utilizing the available data.

## Structure of the Project
- `data/`: Folder with raw CSV data.
- `notebook.ipynb`: Scripts for data cleaning, EDA, and analytical queries.
- `app.py`: Streamlit-based interactive dashboard.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.

## How to Install
1. Download the repository to your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-analysis.git
```
2. Install necessary Python packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use
1. **Data Preparation**: The `notebook.ipynb` file includes scripts for data cleaning and preparation.
2. **Data Exploration (EDA)**: Use the Python scripts provided for data analysis and exploration. Insights from EDA are vital for understanding the trends in air quality.
3. **Data Visualization**: Execute the Streamlit dashboard for an interactive data visualization experience:

```
streamlit run app.py
```
You can access the dashboard through `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

## Sources of Data
The project utilizes air quality data from the [Final Project of Learning Data Analysis with Python](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RhU3gJlkteaAQfyn9XOVAz7a5o1-etgr/view) by [Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/).

## Data Exploration
Detail the principal findings and insights obtained from the exploratory data analysis.

## Data Visualization
Showcase the visual outputs produced by the Streamlit dashboard.

## Acknowledgements
This project was created as a part of the Dicoding Academy's "Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python" course, which focuses extensively on Python for data analysis. A heartfelt thank you to the Dicoding Academy for providing essential learning materials, support, and a learning platform.
